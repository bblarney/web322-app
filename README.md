WEB322 Web App - Brett Larney

1. The web application was a semester long project for a 3rd semester web programming class. 
It was broken into manageable 2 week long segments. The goal of this project was to work with and learn different
web development languages and tools such as HTML, CSS, Javascript, Bootstrap, and MongoDB.

2. In this project a web server was created to manage requests for the web application. On the front end, a user
would see a home and about screen, as well as a login option. Upon logging in, the user gains access to an employee
management system, able to add and remove employees and their departments, and more. A database was created in MongoDB (mLab)
which was used to store user login information as well as all of the employees in the system.

3. From this project I learned a lot about different web tools that can be used to create a powerful web application.
I learned how to store and retrieve login information from a cloud database, as well as any other data.
